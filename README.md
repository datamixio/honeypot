# HONEYPOT: THE TRUTH TRAP

Welcome to the filthy underbelly of the internet, you voyeuristic bastards! What you're looking at is a HONEYPOT - that's right, a digital Venus flytrap for the technically curious and morally flexible.

## WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

This abomination of code is a simple SSH server that does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING except spit out a recruitment message for the corporate overlords at Datamix. That's right - we're using one of the most fundamental security protocols to ADVERTISE. The City would be proud.

## HOW TO USE THIS DIGITAL GARBAGE

```
go run main.go
```

Then sit back in your ergonomic chair and watch as unsuspecting SSH connections get greeted with the digital equivalent of a subway advertisement. It's running on port 22 because SUBTLETY IS DEAD.

## THE TRUTH

This is what the internet has become - a cesspool where even the protocols designed for security are now just another billboard. Every port a potential advertisement, every connection a chance to SELL SELL SELL.

Want to join Datamix? Of course you do. Send an email to ping@datamix.io and tell them Spider sent you. They won't know what the hell you're talking about, and THAT'S THE POINT.

## DISCLAIMER

If you're running this on a production server, you're either a genius or an idiot. I'm betting on the latter. Port 22 requires root privileges, you filthy animal.

THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE, BUT FIRST IT WILL PISS YOU OFF.
